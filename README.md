# Advent of Code 2024 â€“ Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the daily [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, implemented in Python. 
Each problem is solved in a separate folder.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming event created by Eric Wastl, offering a new challenge every day in December.
These challenges cover a variety of programming and algorithmic concepts, making it a great way to practice and improve your skills.

## Note
Yes, I know I'm missing the last two days... but come on, it's Christmas!
